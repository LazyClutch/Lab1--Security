\section*{Task 1: SQL injections}

% Some examples
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Here's a caption.},
                   language=SQL,
                   label=lst:sqlInjection]
  SELECT * FROM Customers
  WHERE id = 4 or 1 = 1;
\end{lstlisting}
% Use \autoref to refer to a listing by its label
The statement shown in \autoref{lst:sqlInjection} is the result of a SQL injection.

% \lstinline seems to be a good idea for inlining code, especially when the
% command contains backslashes, braces and the likes of them
The following is a command with symbols with special meaning in \LaTeX: \lstinline{grep "report\|open"}
